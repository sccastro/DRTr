# Joelâ€™s awesome function -------------------------------------------------
#' Combine .csv Files
#'
#' Use this function to read in a series of .csv files and transform them into one data.frame. Make sure to save the output to a data.frame. See Examples for more.
#'
#' @param fpath The direcotry that contains all of the .csv files to be combined.
#' @param dataname The name you would like the combined .csv output data.frame to have.
