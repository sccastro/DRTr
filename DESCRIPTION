Description: Collection of functions for reading, analyzing, and visualizing Reaction Time
    and Hit Rate data from Detection Response Tasks. It implements previous R
    packages to power simple processing of multiple file formats (i.e. .txt,
    .csv) into a readable data frame, summary statistics, and standard
    visualizations for Reaction Time, Hit Rate, Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff, A prime,
    and others. It seemlessly integrates with science measurement hardware
    such as the Red Scientific Detection Response Task.
